# Cosmetics E-commerce Example

This example shows a very small e-commerce site built with **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS**. It includes pages for product listing, product details, a cart, and a simple checkout flow. Cart state is stored locally using React context.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies (Node.js 18+ recommended):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Open `http://localhost:3000` to view the site.

## Project Structure

- `pages/` – Next.js pages
- `components/CartContext.js` – simple cart logic
- `data/products.js` – sample product data
- `styles/globals.css` – Tailwind CSS setup

This repo is intended as a minimal starting point and does not include production features like payments or user accounts.
